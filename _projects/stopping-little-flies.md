# Stopping Little Flies

**Team:** Sorry Little Fly  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement
Spotted lanternflies reproduce rapidly; each female lays 3 egg masses of 30–60 eggs, allowing populations to explode in a single season. SLFs feed on sap, weakening vines, reducing cold hardiness, and potentially killing plants. Current removal methods are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and risk damaging vines. **Impact:** Destroying egg masses reduces SLF reproduction, lowering seasonal infestations and protecting yield and vine health. A plant-safe, scalable tool could be used across vineyards and other sites, targeting the root source of infestations and increasing overall population control.

### Concept A (primary): Radial Compression Mechanism
**What it is:**  
A handheld circular frame fits around the vine, positioning radially arranged claws over each egg mass. A manual lever converts input force into uniform inward radial compression, crushing and destroying eggs without damaging the plant.

**How it would be used:**  
- Place the open circular frame around the egg mass so the claws align properly.  
- Pull the lever, causing the claws to move inward and apply compressive force on egg cluster  
- Release the lever and reposition the device on the next egg mass.  
- Repeat until all visible egg masses are treated in the vine section.

**Why it’s better than the status quo:**  
- Provides controlled, consistent crushing force versus variable scraping.  
- Distributes load radially, reducing bark damage and minimizing vine injury.  
- Chemical-free, repeatable across workers, and faster per egg mass than manual scraping.

**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:**  
Build a scaled mechanical prototype with 3–4 arms and lever linkage. Test crushing force on mock egg masses while measuring pressure on a vine analog to ensure plant-safe operation.

**Key risks / unknowns**
 - Force vs. bark damage; excessive force could harm vines, experimentally determine safe range  
 - Incomplete egg destruction; may not properly prevent reproduction, validate using mock materials  
 - Field usability; operating the tool may be slow or ergonomically challenging, test timed trials and ergonomics

**Questions for the client**
- Is crushing the egg mass sufficient, or must it be fully removed and disposed of? *Decision affected:* Required force and containment design  
- If crushing is sufficient, how much force is required to reliably destroy eggs? *Decision affected:* Feasibility of lever mechanism and force calibration  
- How tall are average grapevines, and can an average worker reach the required height? *Decision affected:* Frame size and tool adjustability  
- Where are egg clusters most commonly located on a grapevine? *Decision affected:* Arm spacing and tool positioning
