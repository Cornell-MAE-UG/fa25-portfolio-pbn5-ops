 Designed a 2D lifting mechanism within a 150 cm × 50 cm design space to maximize lifting height and load capacity using rigid components and pin supports. The final configuration used a Tolomatic IMA55 linear actuator with a roller screw (RN04 lead) and an 18-inch stroke, selected for its exceptionally high thrust capacity of up to 36 kN (~8,000 lbf). The mechanism geometry was optimized through static equilibrium and kinematic analysis to achieve maximum vertical displacement without overloading the supports. The actuator’s long stroke and compact design enabled a smooth, controlled lift to the full 50 cm height. This project demonstrated practical application of actuator selection, load-path optimization, and mechanism synthesis under spatial and structural constraints.
